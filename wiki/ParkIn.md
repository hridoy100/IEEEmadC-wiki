# Short description : 

The number of personal vehicles usage is increasing manifold. People prefer personal vehicles to
commute than depend on public transportation. Finding a parking space in most metropolitan
areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. Due to this there is a need
to provide sufficient parking places coupled with plenty of slots to help the user park his
vehicle safely, also to ensure the user does not end up parking on non-parking area and cause
discomfort to pedestrian.Due to this there is a need to provide sufficient parking places coupled
with plenty of slots to help the user park his vehicle safely, also to ensure the user does not
end up parking on non-parking area and cause discomfort to pedestrian. The idea behind our
Android Application- “**ParkIn**” is to help the user analyse area’s where parking is available and
number of slots free in that area.Additionally, the user can pre-book a slot in the area he desires
for some consecutive days (along with the daily service) if it is available. This will help reduce
the load on the administrator as his physical work reduces drastically and user can search the
parking slot through Android Application.User can pay after completion of parking service he
received. “**ParkIn**” Application relieves the user from the hassle of manually searching and
waiting for empty slots to park the vehicle.

  <br>
</p>

User will have to confirm his payment. Our payment window has payment methods. After confirmation, the service will be completed. We haven't implemented the API for the methods as it is paid API.

### 2 Server Side

The server side processing will be enabled using PHP and MySQL. The administrator has to control the server side. Whenever a new user registers with the app, the record will be stored in the server side database. When the registered user selects the location and vehicle type, immediately server receives the client’s request. After receiving the request for the desired location, server processes the related information and responds accordingly. Furthermore, the administrator has direct option to view user details and slot details stored on the server direct via the application. There will also be a ongoing server written in java which will run threads to see if rent time is starting for a customer or ending and thus sending proper notifications.
